# BasicCalculator

### Prerequisites



### Run tests

* **Run tests from terminal**:
  
  `gradlew.bat test --tests RunTests`
  

* **Run tests from IDE**: Open RunTests Class and click on the Green play icon.

If you want to run tests not in headless mode then you have to comment this line 
`options.addArguments("--headless");` from Steps class.

### Reports
* **Running tests in local**:
The report will create in builds/courgette-report directory.

* **Reports by me**:
  The report will be in report/<date> directory.

### Improvements
There are some feature idea in *improvements.txt* which can improve the calculator page and tests.
