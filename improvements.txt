Can be improved Prototype with:
    - Another error message when both of the numbers are not numbers
    - Integer only can be rounded correctly (Example: when the answer is 34.98765 then with integers only answer is 34 but can be 35)

Can be improved Tests with:
    - Page object for Basic calculator page
    - Different report structure where it's easier to see what the problem is with each build
    - Cross browser testing
