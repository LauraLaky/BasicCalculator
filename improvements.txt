Can improve Prototype with:
    - Another error message when both of the numbers are not numbers
    - Integer only can be rounded correctly (Example: when the answer is 34.98765 then with integers only answer is 34 but can be 35)

Can improve Tests with:
    - Different report structure where it's easier to see what the problem is with each build
    - Cross browser testing
    - less code duplication
